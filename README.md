# odin-recipes
My first TOP project in HTML

The goal is to create a basic recipe website.
It will consist of a main index page which will have links to a few recipes.

By doing this project, i want to test my capacities in basic HTML coding, such as:

Changing the text to bold or italic;
Dividing the text into paragraphs;
Creating ordered and unordered lists;
Adding links to other websites;
Displaying the title of the website on top of the browser;
Adding image files to the website.
